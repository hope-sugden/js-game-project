# **JavaScript Quiz**
_This is our third project on the _nology course and our second JavaScript project._
_We were challenged to make a game of our choosing. Some examples we were given were Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four and Point & Shoot games . I decided to make a quiz._
_I used HTML, SCSS and JavaScript._
_This is the link to the quiz https://hope-sugden.github.io/js-game-project/_



## **User Guide**

### There are 10 questions in total and you have 15 seconds to answer each question. 
### If you get a question right, the answer will turn green and a point will be added to your score. 
### If you get a question wrong, the answer will turn red and you won't get any points. 
### 3 seconds after the question has been answered the next question will be displayed. If you take longer than 15 seconds to answer, the quiz will automatically move onto the next question. 
### Your final score will display in the results page after all the questions have been answered, with a message depending on your score. 
### The home button can be pressed at any time which will reset the quiz so it can be replayed as many times as you like.

## **Limitations**

### If the user double clicks and answer or clicks 2 options to a question then the following question is skipped and the timer counts double speed.
