# **JavaScript Quiz**
_This is our third project on the _nology course and our second JavaScript project._
_We were challenged to make a game of our choosing. Some examples we were given were Tic Tac Toe, Connect Fourand Point & Shoot games . I decided to make a quiz._
_I used HTML, SCSS and JavaScript._
_This is the link to the quiz https://hope-sugden.github.io/js-game-project/_
